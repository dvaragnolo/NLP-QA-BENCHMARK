# Introduction

This page presents a performance evaluation of a Question-Answering System that automatically translates Natural Language Questions into SPARQL queries, over the Smithsonian American Art Museum’s CIDOC-CRM representation. 

The architecture of the system includes a pipeline with three modules: 
* Partial Semantic Representation, composed of two steps: the dependency parser of Stanza, and transformation into a set of partial Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs).
* Pragmatic interpretation, which rewrites the partial semantic representations of a question into a set of variant meanings of the question in the domain-specific context.
* SPARQL Generator which is applied to the Semantic Query Representation solution and generates the corresponding SPARQL query representation.

The repository is structured as follows: 
* The dataset is organized by folders, within which there is a collection of input questions for the system (in the “questions” directory), and a directory with the results for each question in the set. The results are presented in a comma-separated values (CSV) format for each module of the system pipeline, in the “results” directory.
In addition, the results file includes a comparison between the SPARQL response generated by the query (“Gen. Query Response”) and a manually validated SPARQL response retrieved from a manually created SPARQL query (“Man. Query Response”). The latter can be found in the “validation” directory.
The comparison is conducted by checking if the Gen. Query Response contains the Man. Query Response. More details on this comparison can be found in the algorithm description file.


## Evaluation
The main evaluation set is made by 50 different questions on Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM) Knowledge Base. The collection of natural language questions include several different request on art domain, asking information about artists and artefact.

```JSON

The file presents the results of all the sub-modules of the system: the Partial Semantic Representation, the Query Ontology Representation and the Genererated SPARQL Query. Moreover, are presented the SPARQL Response of the generated query, the SPARQL Response of the manual validation set and the comparation result between thw two responses. The comparation is boolean and it gives true if the SPARQL Response of the generated query contains the the SPARQL Response of the manual validation set.

## CIDOC-QA-BENCHMARK Set - 5'000 NL Questions from https://github.com/NicolaiGoon/CIDOC-QA-BENCHMARK/

The second evaluation is about a set of 5'000 questions based on 10 query templates (of different radius). These questions are retrieved from 
N. GOUNAKIS, M. MOUNTANTONAKIS, and Y. TZITZIKAS "Evaluating a Radius-based Pipeline for Question Answering over Cultural
(CIDOC-CRM based) Knowledge Graphs" (2023). The datasets can be found at this link https://github.com/NicolaiGoon/CIDOC-QA-BENCHMARK/. The directory CIDOC-QA-BENCHMARK includes the results grouped by template, with 500 samples for each one. 

### Templates
In the CIDOC-QA-BENCHMARK repository, can be found the SPARQL template queries that sent to <https://triplydb.com/smithsonian/american-art-museum/sparql/american-art-museum>. The placeholders {Art Work} and {Artist} are replaced with entities present in the KG. From original templates, we add the following filtrer on SPARQL Query to specify the label of Art Work or Artist).
### Named Entity Recognition
Before the Syntactic Analysis performed by the parser Stanza, a module of Named Entity Recognition is applied. The NER is performed by a Gazetter's technique, which implies a pattern matching of a gazetteer containing all the art works' label and artists' name. The pattern matching is made by longest match. The entity recognized is substituted by a placeholder, recognized as proper name (PROPN) by Stanza. The placeholder is replaced by the original term on the final SPARQL Query generated. In the directory and in the summary below, the results are presented with the use NER module (NER_true) and without it (NER_false).

### Results
The results can be found on the directory CIDOC-QA-BENCHMARK. Each file is csv formatted. Files named "summary" show the results as the table previously presented in "System Result Set". Files named "results" show the results as the files from the evaluation set, without the columns "Gen Query Response" and "Man Data Response".
